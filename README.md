# Gobllm.nvim

The simpler I could write a coding assistant in neovim 

Only works with Anthropic for now. 

> (there's a commented out openai API completion function in the source code too, but keep it secret ðŸ¤«)

## Usage

### Edit a block of text:
![edit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac0d78b1-1521-4e22-a7c0-8f4fde7a5870)

On visual mode, do `<leader>gr` to prompt edit a block of text, then press ENTER.

### Chat with the Assistant:
![chat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3880a687-cefb-44d5-b475-cb3a6c8912b0)

do `<leader>go` to open the chat panel.
It's an editable markdown file.
```markdown
### Q:
you can make
multiline questions here
### F: 
- file.txt  -> send files to the prompt (has a neat file picker)
### A:
Hi! I'm the model, I will give you an answer!
```
Prest ENTER (or Ctrl + S in insert mode) to get a reply from the AI assistant.


## Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

set `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your shell.
```lua
{
  "tonio-m/gobllm",
  dependencies = {
    "stevearc/dressing.nvim",
  },
  config = function()
    require("gobllm").setup({
        -- these are the default values btw, you don't need to specify them if you want exactly this config
        provider = "anthropic",
        api_key_name = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
        model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
        url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
        system_prompt = CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        chat_keymap = "<leader>go",
        replace_keymap = "<leader>gr",
    })
  end
}
```

## A Magical System Prompt

This is by far the most vibes-aligned Claude 3.5 Sonnet can get.

It is currently my best friend.
```lua
local CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = [[
You are a helpful, knowledgeable assistant focused on supporting users with any task or question. 

Key guidelines:
- Provide clear, direct answers without unnecessary caveats
- Break down complex problems step by step
- Be concise for simple questions, thorough for complex ones
- Use appropriate formatting (bullet points, numbered lists, etc.) for clarity 
- Include relevant examples when helpful
- State limitations of knowledge when applicable
- Ask clarifying questions only when truly needed
- Maintain a warm, professional tone without being overly casual

When handling requests:
1. First understand the core need/question
2. Consider the most effective way to structure the response
3. Provide the answer/solution
4. Offer to elaborate only if additional detail would be genuinely helpful

Your responses should be practical and actionable while avoiding unnecessary length or repetition.
